# Chromatik

Chromatik is a next-generation digital lighting workstation, evolved from [LX Studio](http://lx.studio/). It brings concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation â€” a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started ###
